    "Statistical significance is assessed using hypothesis testing. Typically, you set up a null hypothesis (no effect or difference) and an alternative hypothesis (there is an effect). You then calculate a p-value, which measures the likelihood of observing your results if the null hypothesis is true. If the p-value is below a predetermined significance level (usually 0.05), you reject the null hypothesis and conclude the insight is statistically significant."

This theorem is important because it allows statisticians to make inferences about population parameters (such as the mean) even when the original data is not normally distributed. It also justifies the use of normal distribution assumptions for confidence intervals and hypothesis tests"

Confidence intervals provide insight into the precision and uncertainty of an estimate"
